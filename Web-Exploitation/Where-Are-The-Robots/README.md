# Where Are The Robots

## Description

Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:36474

## Hints

* What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Walkthrough

The room title, "Where Are the Robots", refers to the [robots.txt file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt "Wikipedia article on robots.txt file"). A robots.txt file is used by web developers to tell a web crawler how it should behave when crawling the site.

For example, if you wished to stop ALL bots from indexing your ENTIRE site, you would create a file named "robots.txt" and store it at the root of your site directory (https://example.com/robots.txt) and place the following text inside.

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```

Here, the "*" symbol represents all user agents (bots) and the "/" represents the root directory of your site.

If you wished to ONLY block Google from indexing a folder called "example" you would instead use the following text.

```
User-agent: Googlebot
Disallow: /example
```

Keep in mind that a rogue bot can still crawl your site, since it's ultimately up to the bot developer if they choose to comply with your request to not be indexed.

Now that we understand how the robots.txt file works, it's important to understand why it is such an important first stop in vulnerability hunting. Naturally, a file that contains directory names that a developer would not like to be indexed is going to attract a lot of attention. Security researchers, bad actors, vulnerability hunters and bad bots can use the "robots.txt" to get an idea of a sites hidden directories as part of the recoinnaissance phase.

We can view the robots.txt file for this challenges website by visiting https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/robots.txt, where we'll find the following.

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /477ce.html
```

It seems the developer doesn't want anyone indexing a file called ```477ce.html```, so naturally that's our next stop.

Once we navigate to https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/477ce.html, we'll be greeted with this challenges flag.
