## Description

Do you know how to use the web inspector?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Hints

* Use the web inspector on other files included by the web page.

* The flag may or may not be encoded

## Walkthrough

After launching the instance and visiting the website we'll see the homepage for this CTF.

![Web Decode Homepage](./web-decode-homepage.png "Web Decode Homepage")

Viewing the source code for the homepage we won't find anything, but the text on the homepage does tell us that if we're looking for a flag to keep navigating.

Navigating over to the websites about page we'll see text that reads, "Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there."

![Websites about page](./web-decode-about-page.png "Websites about page")

Inspecting the HTML, we'll see the following code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!--...REMOVED FOR BREVITY...-->
    <title>About me</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!--...REMOVED FOR BREVITY...-->
    <section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMTBmOTM3NmZ9">
    <h1>Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there</h1>
    <!--...REMOVED FOR BREVITY...-->
</body>
</html>
```

As we look through the code, the section element begins to stand out. It has a custom attribute, ```notify_true```, whose value is a Base-64 encoded string.

Base-64 encoded string: ```cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMTBmOTM3NmZ9```

Decoding this string from Base-64 reveals the flag ```picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_10f9376f}```.
