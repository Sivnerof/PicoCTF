## Walkthrough

If we go through the source code for the homepage we'll find the following comment in the HTML.

```html
<!-- six_box
end six_box   The flag is not here but keep digging :)-- >
```

We won't find much else in the source code, but if we go through the source code for  ```/css/style.css``` we'll see the following comment in the CSS file:

```css
/** banner_main picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_8de925a7} **/
 .carousel-indicators li {
     width: 20px;
     height: 20px;
     border-radius: 11px;
     background-color: #070000;
}
```





```css
/** banner_main picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_8de925a7} **/
```

```picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_8de925a7}```
