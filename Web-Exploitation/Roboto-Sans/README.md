## Walkthrough

If we view the source code for the homepage we'll see the following comment in the HTML.

```html
<!-- six_box
end six_box   The flag is not here but keep digging :) -->

<!-- We Do Yogas -->
```

Other than the comment in the HTML we won't find anything else on the homepage.

If we view the ```robots.txt``` file for the website we'll see the following entries.

```
User-agent *
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

Disallow: /wp-admin/
```

Here we find another hint related to the challenge.

The strange entries in the ```robots.txt``` file appear to be chopped up Base-64.
