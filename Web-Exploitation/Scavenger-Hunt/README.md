# Scavenger Hunt

## Description

There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/. Can you find it?

## Hints

* You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

## Walkthrough

Starting off by viewing the source code for the webpage at http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/, we'll see the following HTML.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!--...REMOVED FOR BREVITY...-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mycss.css">
    <script type="application/javascript" src="myjs.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--...REMOVED FOR BREVITY...-->
	<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
    <!--...REMOVED FOR BREVITY...-->
  </body>
</html>
```

The HTML contains a piece of the flag hidden within a comment that reads "Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t", the HTML also links to a CSS file and a JavaScript file. Since we're just starting out and don't have much to go on, we might as well check the contents of these other files as well.

Navigating to the CSS file at http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/mycss.css we'll see the following source code.

```css
div.container {
    width: 100%;
}

header {
    background-color: black;
    padding: 1em;
    color: white;
    clear: left;
    text-align: center;
}

/*...REMOVED FOR BREVITY...*/

/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```

It's here within the CSS file, in a comment, that we'll find the second piece of the flag which reads:

> CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0

Now we can make our way to the JavaScript file at http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/myjs.js where we'll see the following code.

```js
function openTab(tabName,elmnt,color) {
    var i, tabcontent, tablinks;
    tabcontent = document.getElementsByClassName("tabcontent");
    for (i = 0; i < tabcontent.length; i++) {
	tabcontent[i].style.display = "none";
    }
    tablinks = document.getElementsByClassName("tablink");
    for (i = 0; i < tablinks.length; i++) {
	tablinks[i].style.backgroundColor = "";
    }
    document.getElementById(tabName).style.display = "block";
    if(elmnt.style != null) {
	elmnt.style.backgroundColor = color;
    }
}

window.onload = function() {
    openTab('tabintro', this, '#222');
}

/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
```

Inside the JavaScript file, hidden within a comment, we'll see text that asks us how can the developer keep Google from indexing their website.
