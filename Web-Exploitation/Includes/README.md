## Walkthrough

If we visit the webpage we'll see text describing file includes.

> On Includes
>
> Many programming languages and other computer files have a directive, often called include (sometimes copy or import), that causes the contents of a second file to be inserted into the original file. These included files are called copybooks or header files. They are often used to define the physical layout of program data, pieces of procedural code and/or forward declarations while promoting encapsulation and the reuse of code.

We'll also see a button that reads "Say hello," if we click on the button an alert will pop up informing us that the code executed is in a seperate file.

> This code is in a separate file!

Let's look for this code by reviewing the HTML source code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <title>On Includes</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  
    <h1>On Includes</h1>
    <p>Many programming languages and other computer files have a directive, 
       often called include (sometimes copy or import), that causes the 
       contents of a second file to be inserted into the original file. These 
       included files are called copybooks or header files. They are often used
       to define the physical layout of program data, pieces of procedural code
       and/or forward declarations while promoting encapsulation and the reuse
       of code.</p>
    <br>

    <button type="button" onclick="greetings();">Say hello</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

Looking at the source code for the webpage we'll see that two files are included. One is a CSS stylesheet and the other a JavaScript file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

We can view both these files by visiting ```/style.css``` and ```/script.js```.


* ```/style.css```:
```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/*  picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_  */
```

* ```/script.js```:

```js
function greetings()
{
  alert("This code is in a separate file!");
}

//  f7w_2of2_df589022}
```

Putting the comments together will reveal the flag.

```picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_df589022}```
