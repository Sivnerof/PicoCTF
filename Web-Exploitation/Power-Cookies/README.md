## Walkthrough

Viewing the HTML source code for the websites homepage will show us that clicking the "Continue as guest" button results in the execution of a function named "continueAsGuest". We'll also see that the source code links to a script named "guest.js".

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Secure Log In</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="guest.js"></script>

    <h1>Online Gradebook</h1>
    <button type="button" onclick="continueAsGuest();">Continue as guest</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

We can view the JavaScript code in "guest.js" by visiting http://[CTF_URL_AND_PORT]/guest.js, where we can find out what exactly the "continueAsGuest" function does.

```js
function continueAsGuest()
{
  window.location.href = '/check.php';
  document.cookie = "isAdmin=0";
}
```

When the "Continue as guest" button is clicked, the "continueAsGuest" function found in "script.js" is executed. The function redirects the user to ```/check.php``` and sets a cookie named "isAdmin" to 0.

Once we're redirected to http://[CTF_URL_AND_PORT]/check.php we'll see text that reads:

> We apologize, but we have no guest services at the moment.

The next logical step is to change the cookie value from 0 to 1 and see if refreshing the page results in any changes.

Cookie before:
* isAdmin:"0"







-----
```
isAdmin:"1"
```
