## Walkthrough

Before logging in to the website, turn on Burp Suite and put the website in scope so we can monitor any network traffic.

Logging in using the credentials ```test:test!``` redirects us to the user homepage where we'll see a message that reads:

> Welcome fellow Human
>
> I was redirected here by a friend of mine but I couldn't find anything. Help me search for flags :-)
