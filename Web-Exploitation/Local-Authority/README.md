## Walkthrough

Once the instance has loaded and we visit the website, we'll see a login form on the homepage.

Submitting the login form with any random input will redirect us to ```/login.php``` where we'll see a login failure message.

> Log In Failed

Viewing the HTML source code for ```/login.php``` we'll see that the page loads a script named "secure.js".

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <title>Login Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="secure.js"></script>
    <!--[...REMOVED FOR BREVITY...]-->
  </body>
</html>
```

Navigating to ```http://[INSTANCE_URL]/secure.js``` we'll see the following JavaScript which reveals the password for the "admin" user:

```js
function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}
```

Now that we have a valid pair of credentials we can login to the website.

Credentials: ```admin:strongPassword098765```

After logging in will be redirected to ```/admin.php``` where we'll find the flag.
