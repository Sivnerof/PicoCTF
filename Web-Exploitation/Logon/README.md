# Logon

## Description

The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/13594/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/13594/ "Pico CTF link for challenges website")) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:13594

## Hints

* Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?

## Walkthrough

If we visit the website for this challenge we'll see a login form.

Logging in with dummy credentials such as ```test:test``` will lead us to a page that tells us we're logged in but cannot see the flag.

If we view the cookies we'll see a cookie named admin with a value set to False.

```admin:"False"```

Changing the value from False to True and reloading the page will reveal the flag needed to solve this challenge.
