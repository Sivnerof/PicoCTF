# PW Crack 2

## Description

Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/14/level2.py "Pico CTF link to download Python password checker program") and you'll need the encrypted [flag](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/14/level2.flag.txt.enc "Pico CTF link to download encrypted flag text file") in the same directory too.

## Hints

* Does that encoding look familiar?

* The str_xor function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.
