## Description

If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in [ASCII](https://www.asciitable.com/ "Article On ASCII Codes")?

## Hints

Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

## Walkthrough

[Hexadecimal](https://www.mathsisfun.com/hexadecimals.html "Math Is Fun Article On Hexadecimal") otherwise known as Base-16 is a numeral system commonly used in computing and programming. In Base-16 every digit has 16 possible choices ranging from 0-f. For example, the number 10 in Base-16 would be written as ```a``` or ```A``` and the number 16 would be written as ```10```. Typically hexadecimal will be prefixed with ```0x``` making it easier to differentiate between other numeral systems or codes.

```0x70``` is the hexadecimal equivalent to the decimal number ```112``` which corresponds to lowercase ```p``` on the ASCII chart. So our flag becomes ```picoCTF{p}```.
